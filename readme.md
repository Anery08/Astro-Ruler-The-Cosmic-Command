## How to Play

1.  **Launch the Game:** Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  **Read the Event:** A card will appear describing a situation.
3.  **Make a Choice:** Two buttons will be displayed at the bottom of the card, representing your options. Click the left button for the left choice, or the right button for the right choice.
4.  **Observe Impacts:** Watch how your decisions affect the four metric bars at the top of the screen (‚ù§Ô∏è Morale, üõ°Ô∏è Integrity, üì¶ Resources, ‚≠ê Reputation).
5.  **Survive!** Keep your metrics balanced. If any metric drops too low (or goes too high for some), it's game over!
6.  **Restart:** If your mission ends, click "Restart Mission" to begin anew.

## Game Mechanics

As Captain, you must balance four crucial aspects of your command:

* **Crew Morale (‚ù§Ô∏è):** Happy crew, productive crew. Low morale leads to dissent and mutiny. Too high, and they might become lazy or demanding.
* **Ship Integrity (üõ°Ô∏è):** The physical state of your vessel. Low integrity means system failures and eventual destruction. Too high might indicate over-engineering and lack of adaptability.
* **Resource Supply (üì¶):** Fuel, oxygen, food, materials. Running out means being stranded or starving. Too much might imply hoarding or wasted space.
* **Galactic Reputation (‚≠ê):** How other species and factions perceive you. Low reputation makes you a target; high reputation can bring unwanted attention or alliances.

Each decision you make will alter these metrics. Pay attention to the subtle cues and think ahead!
